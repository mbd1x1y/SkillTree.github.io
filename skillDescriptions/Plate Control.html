<h2>Plate Control</h2>

Much like "Learning your Edges" and other things that you may hear 
throughout training, but combined with the acknowledgement that you 
also need to learn about your skates and how to adjust your trucks.
<p>
Think about only one skate right now. A roller skate functions just 
like a skateboard: When you lean your weight to one side, the skate 
should turn in that direction. This is because the trucks on the plate 
will flex, and the wheels will turn, causing the skate to turn. 
<p>
I have heard two primary descriptions which leads skaters to their 
"Eureka" moment. The first is "Steer with you knee". If you point your 
knee in the direction you want to go, it is very natural for you weight 
to transfer and activate your plate. The other is "Think about pushing 
with your toes". Push down with your big toe to get your skate to turn 
in that direction, push with you little toe to make your skate turn the 
other way. Both of these force you to tilt your foot and make you 
activate your plate in order to turn, rather than trying to force your 
foot to turn on it's own.
<p>
If your trucks are too tight, there will be no flex when you lean your 
weight. 
This will make all skills that involve turning (pretty much EVERYTHING) 
very difficult. On the flip side, having your trucks too loose will 
make you feel out of control (especially at high speed).
<p>
Tightening and loosening the Kingpin nut on your trucks will allow for 
some adjustment to how much action your trucks have, but it is limited. 
You should not smush the cushions by overtightening, and you should not 
have the truck flop around in your hand because the kingpin nut is too 
lose. The next level of adjustment is done by changing the hardness of 
the cushions. Each plate is different and you will need to check with 
the manufacturer to know which cushions you currently use, and what are 
available for your plate.
<p>
Talk to your teammates! They have all dealt with this and can help you!

Check out this video for a primer on plates and changing cushions.

simply the best quality video I could find. So props to them for that.
