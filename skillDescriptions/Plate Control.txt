Much like "Learning your Edges" and other things that you may hear throughout training, but combined with the acknowledgement that you also need to learn about your skates and how to adjust your trucks.

Think about only one skate right now. A roller skate functions just like a skateboard, which is . When you lean you weight to one side, the skate should turn in that direction. This is because the trucks on the plate will flex, and the wheels will turn, causing the skate to turn. If your trucks are too tight, there will be no flex when you lean your weight. This will make all skills that involve turning (pretty much EVERYTHING) very difficult. On the flip side, having your trucks too loose will make you feel out of control (especially at high speed).

Tightening and loosening the Kingpin nut on your trucks will allow for some adjustment to how much action your trucks have, but it is limited. You should not smush the cushions by overtightening, and you should not have the truck flop around in your hand because the kingpin nut is too lose. The next level of adjustment is done by changing the hardness of the cushions. Each plate is different and you will need to check with the manufacturer to know which cushions you currently use, and what are available for your plate.

Talk to your teammates! They have all dealt with this and can help you!

Check out this video for a primer on plates and changing cushions. Note: I'm not sponsored by or affiliated with Crazy skates. This was simply the best quality video I could find. So props to them for that.
